1. Port forward the port 25565.
Here are some links to help you port forward:

http://www.portchecktool.com/

2. Open "Start Server.bat" (don't open as Admin) on Windows, "Start Server.command" on Mac, and "Start Server.sh" on Linux.  If it brings up an issue about Java, edit the file with a text editor and replace "Java" with the location to your Java installation (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre8\bin\java" or the equivalent on Mac/Linux).

3. "Unloading dimension 7" should be one of the last lines in the console before the server is up.

4. Connect to the server using your local IP and the port (e.g: 192.168.1.44:25565).


If you get an error about invalid maximum heap size, it's likely because of your java version. Download "Java 64bit Offline" on the java website.

Only increase RAM if you plan to play with many people!
If you want to increase the server RAM, edit your Start Server file with a text editor and replace the line starting with "java" with:
java -Xmx6048M -Xms6048M -jar forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860.jar nogui


The server has 4GB by default, which should be plenty, but if you plan to have more than 4-5 people play, change it to 6GB+
