License:

I give full permission for anyone to release a modified/spin-off version of this pack on CurseForge only. The modified version must state that it is a modified version of Rebirth of the Night and must link back to the main CurseForge page for Rebirth of the Night in a clear and concise way.
You may modify the pack for your own personal use, but support will likely not be given for modified versions of the pack. This includes adding and removing mods.
You may not charge people to get access to any modified versions that are made. Money through donations such as Patreon is fine, so long as they are purely donations.
You may not charge people for individual assets of this pack and/or claim them as your own.
You may not redistribute non-modified versions of pack anywhere. Modified versions can only be released on CurseForge.
You may not use assets from this pack and claim them as your own (this includes scripts, textures, etc). You may use scripts from this pack as an education tool to learn Zenscript, CraftTweaker, etc, but do not copy entire scripts, config files, etc.
You may not remove or edit the Akliz button on the main menu for any reason.
You may not partner with any server hosting company for any modified versions. Suggesting people to use Akliz via our referral link is recommended but not required.
All modified/spin-off versions of this pack must abide by the same license that was just stated. Please change your license on your pack's CurseForge page to "Custom License" and copy and paste this license.
Please contact CalaMariGold if you have any questions or concerns.
