    Adult dragons can be bred by
feeding them a mixture of
elemental items, but first these
items must be gathered.






Fire Lilies and Frost Lilies are
used to make Fire Mixture and
Frost Mixture, respectively.
This mixture can be used to
breed two tamed dragons. By
interacting with a male dragon
with the substance then
interacting with a female dragon
will result in the two breeding.







Once the dragons have finished
mating, the female will lay a
single egg, of any color.







Dragon horns canbe used to summon
and desummon dragons. One can
desummon a dragon by interacting
with it while holding a horn, and
blowing a horn can summon one.
