Simply creating ice breath is
not the only way Ice Dragons
dispatch their prey. The also
have many different attacks.







The dragon's ice blast attack
fires a steady stream of frost
from the beast's mouth. Younger
dragons are less effective at
this attack, while larger ones
can freeze nearby terrain,
inflicting massive amounts of
damage.







The ice blast isn't the only
elemental attack. The dragon
can also build up a blast of
ice into a solidified block.
This explosive ice cube is then
thrown towards the dragon's
prey. Only older dragons are
capable of this attack.




One of the most common ice
dragon attack is the dragon's bite.
