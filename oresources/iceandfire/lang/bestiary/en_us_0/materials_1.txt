Wither bones can also be made into
wither bone shards, which replace
flint when making dragonbone
arrows.







Dragon flesh can also be harvested
from dragons. This meat cannot be
cooked, and has different effects
based on what type of dragon it
came from. Fire Dragon flesh will

sear its eater, and Ice Dragon
flesh can slow its consumer to
a halt. Though some cults may 
claim to gain great power from 
consuming this flesh, I would
not recommend it.







Dragon hearts can only be dropped
once by each corpse. I currently
am not aware of their purpose...
