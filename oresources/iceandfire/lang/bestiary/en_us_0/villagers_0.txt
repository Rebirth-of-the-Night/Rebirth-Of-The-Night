    By chance I managed to come
upon an Igloo village. Inside
were what appeared to be normal
villagers, however in heavy
coats and carrying large spears.






These villagers had a wide variety
of trades and even offered very
lucrative items such as ice
dragon blood. However, their
most common trade was the fishing
spear.










This nifty tool is very effective
at capturing many types of fish.
Simply aiming and holding it at
water seems to conjure fish from
the depths. It is very valuable
to me as it helps feed my young
Ice Dragon.
