    A second magical ore associated
with supernatural creatures is the
sapphire ore.




Sapphire ore is found randomly in
snowy biomes and its drop can be
traded with snow villagers.



Nuggets of either gold or silver
can be stored into placeable
piles, like so.











The only way to obtain more
information about the
magical world is to research
other writer's works. This
can be done by crafting a
lectern.
