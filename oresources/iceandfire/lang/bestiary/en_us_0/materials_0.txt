    After you have slain a
dragon or come across a dead dragon,
you can begin carving its carcass 
by interacting with it.






Dragon scales are the most
common material that can be recovered
from those dread reptiles. They can be crafted
into suits of armor, which are very
durable.





The next most common loot one can
receive are dragon bones.







Dragon bones are used in many
recipes, but are mostly for crafting
tools and weapons. These recipes
usually involve the use of wither
bone instead of sticks. Wither bones
can be gathered from those black
skeletons in the Nether, which I
postulate are the ruined remains of 
Endermen.
