Each stage in a dragon's life
means different changes to
their behavior and attacks.
In the earliest stage, the
dragon is unable to spout
blasts and is limited to
biting attacks. Once it is
in it's second stage, it
can breath weak frost and
do mild amounts of damage.
The most notable development
of the third stage is the
gaining of the ice charge
attack, which can deal large
amounts of damage.

Stage 3 dragons are also the
most common type of dragons
found in nature.

Whereas stage 3 was the dragon's
final teenage form, stage 4 is
when a dragon is a mature adult,
capable of creating eggs. Stage
4 is generally more powerful and
cannot be found in roosts. They
occupy large caverns beneath a
snow biome's surface.

Stage 5 produces a truly terrifying
animal. They follow all the other
rules of a stage 4 dragon, except
much more powerful and deadly.
They are incredibly rare, and it
is unheard of for a single soul to
defeat one.
