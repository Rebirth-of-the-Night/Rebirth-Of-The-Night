    After hatching my very own
dragon, I realized that the
creature favored me as its
parent. This creature wandered
about aimlessly, however it
usually stayed in my general
area. Since dragons, are
animals, they must require
food, so I brought in a
rabbit. First, the dragon
was reluctant to take any
action, but it soon tried
to bite the rabbit. The
feeble little dragon was
barely able to take down
the rabbit, so I decided
to feed the beast in a
different way.


    I thew down a slab
of mutton, and the dragon
quickly raced towards it
and consumed it.

    Dragons are ancient
creatures, and it must
take a while for them to
mature. However, I devised
a plan to spur my dragon's
growth faster. I did this
by crafting Dragon Meal.
