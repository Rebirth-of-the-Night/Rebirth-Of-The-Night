Dragon skulls are also only
dropped once from bodies. These
large bones are used to make
command staffs and can be
placed on the ground. They can
also be put onto banners for
a dragon shape.






Dragon blood, both fire and
ice variants, certainly
have very magical properties.
However, these properties are
certainly elusive, and I must
research more into them...
