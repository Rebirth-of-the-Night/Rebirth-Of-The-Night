    A small, tattered note clings to
the binding of the bestiary. It
reads:


"This manuscript is meant to be a
guide to those who wish to inform
themselves about the greatest
wonders across worlds.
It will cover some of the basics of
designing tools, armor, and weapons
to tracking, hunting, and learning
about mysterious creatures."

    The bestiary then goes on to
describe supernatural changes in
the generation of the world,
starting with strange ores.


An ore with mystical properties,
Silver ore can be found at the
same layers gold can be found.




It can be smelted into ingots
which have a variety of uses.








Silver weaponry does extra
damage to the undead due to
its magical properties.
