Simply creating fire is not the
only way Fire Dragons dispatch
their prey. The also have many
different attacks.







The dragon's fire blast attack
fires a steady stream of flames
from the beast's mouth. Younger
dragons are less effective at
this attack, while larger ones
can scorch nearby terrain,
inflicting massive amounts of
damage.







The fire blast isn't the only
elemental attack. The dragon
can also build up a blast of
flames into a solidified block.
This explosive fireball is then
thrown towards the dragon's
prey. Only older dragons are
capable of this attack.




One of the most common fire
dragon attack is the dragon's bite.
