Armor for dragons can also be
crafted. It is most commonly
made from iron, gold and
diamond. Dragon armor is made
in the same shape of normal
armor, except it uses blocks
instead of ingots.



One can also skillfully craft
a Dragon Bone Flute out of iron
and Dragon Bone. This instrument
can calm a tame flying dragon and
bring it towards the ground.
