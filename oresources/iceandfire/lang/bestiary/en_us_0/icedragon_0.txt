    So the legends are true. Such
beings are not extinct at all, 
but may still be found within
that mystical realm of twilight. 
Very well. I shall try as well 
as I can to describe such a beast 
and its activities.









The appearance of the beast is
obviously reptilian. However, it
is much larger than the average
reptile; Individuals I have seen

range from the size of a pig to
25 blocks! There are even rumors
of larger dragons, sleeping in
ancient crypts under the ice.

    Another notable feature they
possess is the ability of flight.
This is indicated by the
development of large wings, used
in aviation. All though the beasts
seem sluggish at first, they can
lift off and fly swiftly after prey.

    Perhaps the most dangerous
aspect about them is their ability
to produce ice breath from their mouths.
They use this power to freeze their
prey alive. 
Perhaps they prefer the taste.
