# This file is for base rocks 
# the most common igneous, intrusive rock in the continents' crest is Granite; red for OW and black for Beneath (bedrock)
#	Dacite is most common in old Rome, Romania, apart from a terrain of hills and plains, they have dense forests. We're going off the terrain there (hills, coniferous)
#	Andesite is one of several igneous stones (bedrock pockets)
#	Rhyolite is an extrusive equivalent to granite (warm and tropical bedrock)
#	Gabbro is common in the ocean crust and it's found at higher formations (higher ocean)
#	Basalt is the most common volcanic stone, rich in iron and magnesium a big deal of islands are composed of it, either tropical or Icelandic (full islands, mushroom, magic)
#	Komatiite is rare a volcanic nowadays more common to the tropics and warm places (rare, magical, sparse)
# the most common metamorphic stone, mostly derived from clay and mud, is Gneiss (middle and swamps)
#	Schist forms part of Mount Everest's peak (top layer)
# 	Eclogite is formed at high pressures and only comes up in xenoliths, which means enveloped in larger rocks. It's more common at somewhat lower temperatures (middle height pockets, beneath) 
#	Marble occurs within dolomite and limestone (sedimentary pockets)
#	Quartzite derives from sandstone (desert)
#	Migmatite (gneiss and granite pockets)
#	Soapstone (middle level water and river)
# the most common sedimentary stone fond in hills, downland, caves and eroded landscapes is limestone (plains, grassland, gravel beach)
# 	Dolomite is similarly common, but used here for higher altitudes based on resistance to erosion (plains, grassland, gravel beach)
#	Chalk is a common rock to Europe (pockets in limestone)
#	Shale is a kind of sedimentary mud-stone (swamp, water)
#	Siltstone is a kind of sedimentary mud-stone (swamp, water)
#	Greywacke is a hard sandstone (wasteland, dead, spooky)
#	Chert occurs in limestone, chalk, and dolomite (pockets)
