    D:"Attribute Base Attack Damage"=1.0

    # Base ATTACK_SPEED attribute for the player. Vanilla is 4.0F. This value only affects non-weapons, such as fists. An attack speed of 4.0 means 4 attacks per second. Higher values mean faster attack swing recovery. Attack speed formula    -->    20 / attackSpeed. 1.6 attack speed takes 12.5 ticks to recover after an attack swing, which means 1.6 attacks per second. 0.8 means 25 ticks to recover after an attack swing. 4.0 means 5 ticks to recover after an attack. It is best if you do not adjust this value!
    D:"Attribute Base Attack Speed"=4.0

    # Base REACH_DISTANCE attribute for the player. Vanilla is 4.0F in singleplayer, and increased to 5.0F in multiplayer to account for latency.

    D:"Base Critical Percent Damage"=1.5

    # The minimum cooldown (in ticks) for an attack swing cooldown. The default for this setting is 8, which means the minimum attack speed cooldown is 8 ticks. This translates to the maximum attack speed of a weapon being 2.5 and any attack speed value higher than 2.5 will not affect how fast the weapon attacks (unless the player attack speed is slowed or affected by mining fatigue, then higher attack speed values counteract the debuff). [range: 5 ~ 20, default: 8]

    # Set to true to remove the following vanilla feature that makes 'Harming' & 'Healing' tipped arrows essentially useless: 'Arrows of Harming' (and 'Arrows of Healing' when used against undead mobs) do not add any amount of damage to the arrow. Instead, the arrow damage is first calculated, then checked to see if it is below 12 damage. If the arrow's damage is less than 12, the 'Harming' effect of the arrow makes up the difference to ensure the arrow does exactly 12 damage. Therefore, an unenchanted bow cannot deal more than 12 damage using 'Harming' (or 'Healing' to undead) arrows. However, if the arrow would deal more than 12 damage, the harming effect is entirely neutralized. This means that bows enchanted with Power I through Power III very rarely utilize the arrow at full charge, and any Power level above III never utilizes 'Arrows of Harming' effectively at full charge when against unarmored mobs/players.

    # 
    # [Bow=minecraft:bow]    [Damage Multiplier=1.00]    [Velocity Multiplier=0.90]    [Ticks=0]
    # 
    # [Bow] must include both the resource domain and path for the bow, such as 'minecraft:bow' or 'spartanweaponry:longbow_iron'
    # [Damage Multiplier] multiplies the damage of arrows.
    # The base damage of an arrow is 2, and a fully charged shot deals between 8 and 10 damage.
    # The formula for the final damage of a bow (using a vanilla flint arrow with 2 baseDamage) is    -->    (baseVelocity * baseDamage]) + random.nextInt(baseVelocity * baseDamage / 2) + 2    -->    (~3 * 2) + random.nextInt(~3 * 2 / 2) + 2
    # For example, if you set [Damage Multiplier] to 1.5 (meaning the damage of a vanilla flint arrow would now be 3 instead of 2) the final damage of that fully-charged shot would be 11 to 14.5 damage.
    # [Velocity Multiplier] multiplies the velocity of arrows.
    # The velocity of a fully-charged arrow (meaning a critical, with a trail of particles) averages 3.
    # For example, if you set [Velocity] to 1.2 (meaning the velocity of all arrows shot from this bow is now 3.6 instead of 3) the final damage of that fully-charged shot (with a base damage of 2) would be 9.2 to 11.8 damage. Velocity affects damage!
    # The following entry    -->    [Bow=spartanweaponry:crossbow_wood]    [Damage Multiplier=0.80]    [Velocity=1.25]    [Ticks=0]    -->    would cut the base damage of crossbow by 20%, but increase the velocity of the arrows/bolts shot by it by 25%.
    # This entry would keep the damage of a fully-charged shot roughly the same, however, the velocity would be greatly increased.
    # The maximum velocity multiplier is 1.5, anything over this value will do nothing! The reason being is that the arrow travels too fast, leading to visual anomalies.
    # If the arrows look like they are swerving off to the side, it means the velocity is too high and you'll have to lower it.
    # Longbows from SpartanWeaponry already have a velocity multiplier of 1.2, try not to increase velocity much more.
    # Crossbows from SpartanWeaponry already have a velocity multiplier of 1.5, do not increase it any further!
    # SpartanWeaponry now has a config that fuctions very similar to this one, so use this bow tweaker config for other mods that add bows or for editing the vanilla bow.
    # [Ticks] adds or subtracts ticks from the draw speed of bows. The draw speed in ticks of a vanilla bow is 20.
    # Setting [Ticks] to 20 would Float the amount of time it takes to fully draw back a vanilla bow.
    # Setting [Ticks] to -10 would reduce the amount of time it takes to fully draw back a vanilla bow by half.

"custom weapons" {
    # Adjust the properties of melee weapons, such as animation, property, sweep, reach, critical strike chance, critical strike damage, and on-hit potion effects. The [Potion Effect] field is optional. Example below:
    # 
    # [Weapon Substring=pike_]    [Sound Type=POLEARM]    [Animation=STAB]    [Property=TWOHAND]    [Sweep=0]    [Additional Reach=1.0]    [Crit Chance=10]    [Additional Additional Crit Damage=0]    [Potion Effect=minecraft:poison,1,60]
    # 
    # The [Weapon Substring] field can be simply 'pike_' so that all weapons containing the word 'pike_' will be affected, such as 'spartanweaponry:pike_wooden' or 'spartanweaponry:pike_iron'
    # If you would rather adjust properties of a specific weapon, you may put the resource path such as 'glaive_diamond' (do not include the resource domain such as 'spartanweaponry:')
    # The order in this list is important, as it is greedy and will find the first string match! The instance [Weapon Substring=glaive_diamond] should be above the instance [Weapon Substring=pike_] for example.
    # 
    # The [Sound Type] field takes the values BLADE, BLUNT, AXE, POLEARM and changes how the weapon sounds.
    # BLADE should be assigned to bladed weapons such as swords, sabers, and rapiers.
    # BLUNT should be assigned to heavy blunt weapons such as maces, warhammers, and hammers.
    # AXE should be assigned to weapons such as axes, battleaxes, and pickaxes, and shovels, and hoes.
    # POLEARM should be assigned to all polearms, such as spears, pikes, glaives, and staves.
    # 
    #  The [Animation] field takes the values SWEEP, CHOP, or STAB and changes the attack animations of weapons.
    # SWEEP is an animation that sweeps across the lower screen. Additionally, it increases the width of the attack's hitbox based off the weapon's sweep level. This animation is best on weapons with [Sweep].
    # CHOP is very similar to minecraft's default attack animation, and works well with weapons such as axes, hammers, or pickaxes.
    # STAB is an animation that rotates the weapon and then extends it forwards. This animation is best suited for weapons such as spears, pikes, rapiers, and lances.
    # 
    # The [Sweep] field adds sweep to a weapon.
    # Set [Sweep] to 0 to disable sweep on a weapon.
    # Set [Sweep] to 1 to have that weapon deal 1.0 damage to sweep targets.
    # Set [Sweep] to 2 to have that weapon deal 25% damage to sweep targets.
    # Set [Sweep] to 3 to have that weapon deal 50% damage to sweep targets.
    # Set [Sweep] to 4 to have that weapon deal 75% damage to sweep targets.
    # Set [Sweep] to 5 to have that weapon deal 100% of the damage dealt to the main target to the other sweep targets.
    # For each level of sweep above 1, the weapon deals 25% of the main target damage to sweep targets, with a minimum of 1.0 damage.
    # A sweep level higher than 5 (through this config or through the Sweeping enchantmet) does not do any sweep damage, however, it still increases the sweep radius.
    # 
    # The [Property] field takes the values ONEHAND, VERSATILE, MAINHAND, or TWOHAND.
    # ONEHAND can attack in either hand and incur no fatigue penalties.
    # VERSATILE can attack in either hand, however, incurs a fatigue penalty if both hands are occupied.
    # MAINHAND can only attack in the main hand. This is used for weapons such as spears, where a shield/ spear combination makes sense but dual-weilding spears does not.
    # TWOHAND disables the other hand when it is equipped.
    # 
    # The [Additional Reach] field is the reach distance for weapons.
    # Setting [Additional Reach] to 1.0 for a weapon would mean a reach distance of 5.0 (1.0 + base reach distance) blocks for that weapon.
    # 
    # The [Crit Chance] field is the critical chance for weapons.
    # Setting [Crit Chance] to 0.1 for a weapon would mean critical strike chance is 10%.
    # 
    # The [Additional Crit Damage] field is the critical damage multiplier for weapons.
    # Setting [Additional Crit Damage] to 50 for a weapon would mean critical strike damage deals an additional 50% damage.
    # 
    # The [Parry] field enables or disables parrying.
    # The setting 'Disable Parrying' must be set to false in the config to allow weapons to parry.
    # Setting [Parry] to true allows the weapon to parry, and setting [Parry] to false disables parrying for that weapon.
    # 
    # The [Potion Effect] field is optional! It gives weapons a chance to apply a potion effect when you attack an entity with a weapon.
    # Only one potion effect is supported. The order goes for the potion effect  ->  chance, afflict/receive, resource location, power, duration.
    # 'Chance on hit:' can be instead be changed to on 'Critical Strike:' if chance is set to CRIT or 0.0. This setting allows for some interesting crit builds.
    # Setting afflict/receive to AFFLICT causes the victim to gain the potion effect. Setting afflict/receive to RECEIVE causes the attacker gain the potion effect.
    # Duration is in ticks. There are 20 ticks per second. A duration of 100 would apply the potion effect for 5 seconds.
    # 
    # [Potion Effect=1.0,AFFLICT,minecraft:poison,2,600] -> 100% Chance on hit: Afflict Poison II for 30 seconds.
    # [Potion Effect=0.5,AFFLICT,minecraft:instant_damage,3,0] -> 50% Chance on hit: Afflict Harming III.
    # [Potion Effect=0.1,AFFLICT,minecraft:slowness,1,100] -> 10% Chance on hit: Afflict Slowness I for 5 seconds.
    # [Potion Effect=0.2,RECEIVE,minecraft:swiftness,2,160] -> 20% Chance on hit: Receive Swiftness II for 8 seconds.
    # [Potion Effect=0.01,RECEIVE,minecraft:instant_health,2,0] -> 1% Chance on hit: Receive Instant Health II.
