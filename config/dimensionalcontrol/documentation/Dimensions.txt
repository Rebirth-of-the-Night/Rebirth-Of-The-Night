    Notes:
        Used to add a biome printer for the selected dimension. I suggest 500 height, 500 width, 10 spacing, 0 startX, 0 startZ for most cases. This can take a long time, or even run the game out of memory in extreme cases, if the size is set too high. Images are saved to config/dimensionalcontrol/output and overwrite eachother if overwrite is set to true.
