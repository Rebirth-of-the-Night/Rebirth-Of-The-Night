# Commands
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Command documentation:
# There are a few substitutions available to use in the commands:
# Basic number substitutions from world data:
# {DIMENSION}
# {SPAWN_X}
# {SPAWN_Y}
# {SPAWN_Z}.
# 
# Also {SPAWN_POINT_X} etc. that return the spawn point instead of the possible spawn coordinate (like in the End).
# Any occurences of those strings will be replaced by the current dimension ID,
# or the coordinates of the spawn point respectively.
# 
# Random numbers, integer and double type: {RAND:min,max},
# for example {RAND:5,15} or {RAND:1.2,3.9} (the max value is exclusive)
# 
# Real time/clock values:
# 	{TIME_Y} => year   (4 digits: 2017)
# 	{TIME_M} => month  (2 digits: 03)
# 	{TIME_D} => day    (2 digits: 04)
# 	{TIME_H} => hour   (2 digits: 09)
# 	{TIME_I} => minute (2 digits: 05)
# 	{TIME_S} => second (2 digits: 07)
# 	{TIME_TICK} => current world total time in ticks
# 	{TIME_TICK_DAY} => current world/day time in ticks
# 
# The y-coordinate of the top-most block in the world in the given coordinates
# (actually the air block above it): {TOP_Y:x,z} for example: {TOP_Y:-37,538}
# 
# The x y z coordinates of the top-most block in the world in a random location around a given x,z location
# (again, actually the air block above it): {TOP_Y_RAND:x,z;x-range,z-range}
# for example: {TOP_Y_RAND:-37,538;32,32} would be the top block at a random location within
# 32 blocks of x = -37, z = 538. That substitution will be replaced with a string like '-49 72 544' (without the quotes)
# 
# For the player-specific commands, the following substitutions are available:
# {PLAYER_X}, {PLAYER_Y}, {PLAYER_Z} and {PLAYER_NAME}
# 
# Also {PLAYER_BED_X}, {PLAYER_BED_Y} and {PLAYER_BED_Z} for the last set (bed) spawn point.
# There are also {PLAYER_BED_SPAWN_X}, {PLAYER_BED_SPAWN_Y} and {PLAYER_BED_SPAWN_Z} that also check that the bed exists,
# or otherwise they will revert to the fallback world spawn point.
# Note that these will thus load that one chunk to check for the bed.
# 
# The player-specific commands can be targeted to specific counts (like the 6th respawn for example)
# or a multiple of a count (similarly to the dim-loading-command prefix)
# by prefixing the command like so: 'worldprimer-tracked-command-nth <count> <actual command>'
# For example in the playerRespawnCommands:
# worldprimer-tracked-command-nth 3 say The player {PLAYER_NAME} has respawned for the third time at {PLAYER_X}, {PLAYER_Y}, {PLAYER_Z}
# worldprimer-tracked-command-nth %5 say The player {PLAYER_NAME} has respawned for some multiple of 5 times
# 
# Note that the above only applies to the other player-specific commands, but not the playerChangedDimension commands.
# For the playerChangedDimension commands, the same format works instead as for the dimension loading commands:
# worldprimer-dim-command-nth 3 1 say The player {PLAYER_NAME} has entered The End (dimension {DIMENSION}) for the third time
# 
# The substitutions also support very basic arithmetic operations [+-*/].
# So you can do for example:
# fill {SPAWN_X}-2 {SPAWN_Y}+3 {SPAWN_Z}-2 {SPAWN_X}+2 {SPAWN_Y}+7 {SPAWN_Z}+2 minecraft:emerald_block
# 
# Note however that there is no actual order of operations/priorities/grouping.
# The commands are parsed/substituted from the left, and if there is an arithmetic
# operation immediately following the closing curly brace of a substitution, then the value
# of the following string interpreted as a number is added to the substituted value.
# That string following the arithmetic operation is first substituted recursively though,
# which means that the order of operations is actually starting from the right.
# 
# Both the substitutions and the arithmetic operations following them can be escaped by a preceding backslash '\',
# if it should actually appear in the command as-is and not be substituted.
# For example: 'say Foo bar \{SPANW_X}' would become 'say Foo bar {SPANW_X}' in the final command.
# Or 'say Foo bar {SPAWN_X}\+16' would become 'say Foo bar 34+16', assuming the spawn x-coordinate is 34.
# 
# Note, that the earlyWorldCreationCommands and the earlyWorldLoadingCommands
# DO NOT have a world available yet, so the substitutions will NOT happen for those commands.
# Thus, those commands also can't do anything that would require a world.
# An example of this is setting the game rules - those are kept in the WorldInfo object,
# which is stored in the World, so the overworld specifically needs to be loaded for changing any game rules.
# 
# Additionally, the postWorldCreationCommands and the postWorldLoadingCommands will use
# the Overworld (or whichever world is dimension 0) for the substitutions.
# 
# So it's mostly the dimension loading commands that benefit from the {DIMENSION} substitution.
# 
# Note also, that by default in vanilla/Forge, ALL dimensions use the WorldInfo from the overworld,
# which means that they will have the exact same spawn coordinates and game rules etc. as the overworld.
# Some mods may change this so that dimensions can have separate spawn points, game rules etc.
# One such mod is Just Enough Dimensions.

Commands {
    # Commands to run when a dimension gets loaded.
    # You can target these to only be run when a specific dimension loads
    # by specifying the command as 'worldprimer-dim-command <dimId> <command>'.
    # So for example: 'worldprimer-dim-command 1 say The End has loaded!'.
    # You can also run a command only when a dimension loads for specific number of times:
    # 'worldprimer-dim-command-nth <load count> <dim id> <command>'.
    # This would run the command only when the dimension loads for the 'load count'-th time.
    # The count is incremented before the commands are parsed, so in other words the first load is 1, not 0.
    # You can also run the command every count-th time the dimension loads,
    # by prefixing the count with a '%', so for example:
    # worldprimer-dim-command-nth %5 1 say The End has loaded some multiple of 5 times!
    # An asterisk '*' can be used as the dimension ID to run
    # the command in all dimensions (mostly makes sense for the nth variant).

    # Commands to run based on the world time.
    # Must be in the format: 'worldprimer-timed-command <time> <dimension> <command>',
    # where <time> is the total world time in ticks when the command should run.
    # The time can be prefixed with a '%' to make it run periodically, with that interval (basically a modulo).
    # With the periodic time, you can also use offsets, like so:
    # worldprimer-timed-command %1200-80 0 say Something happens in 4 seconds!
    # worldprimer-timed-command %1200 0 say Something happens now!
    # worldprimer-timed-command %1200+80 0 Say something happened 4 seconds ago!
