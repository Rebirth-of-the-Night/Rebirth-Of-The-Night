Another fallen one to join our ranks.
Another death to add to our own.
That was over quickly... perhaps too quickly.
We relish their comeuppance.
Now they understand, now they feel our pain!
Too swift an end for such a foe!
How many more will join us?
They deserve greater torment still!
They do not deserve mercy.
A fitting end...
From the heart of darkness comes our dreadful spite!
Their torment is nothing compared to ours! It must be greater!
The ending of lives is all too brief...
An eye for an eye... we will not cease until they are all blind!

We know how it feels...
Mortality's cruel bite.
A bitter end.
This one cannot escape death, either...
Perhaps you too, will join us...
Death comes for all.
Embrace your mortality...
All things come to an end...
Will you form a new body... or accept your end?
Again it dies... again it returns...
One day, you will not return.
Undeath you have left behind, empty and rotten.
Through foul intercession it is born anew...
Your husk remains, wielder. Slay it, and soon.
Do not let that cursed echo roam... seek it out and crush it.
You have made a mockery of death, wielder...
Its trappings wear down, but its soul endures...
If you have the choice, wielder, do not return...
We are closer to you now, wielder. Closer than ever...
Oblivion draws near...
Do you feel the pull, wielder?
Do not expect this cycle to last forever...
Your echo wanders, wielder... put an end to it.
Even the brightest light casts a shadow...
[levelup]
We grow stronger.
Their strife feeds us.
Darkness creeps closer.
Each one that falls only bolsters our strength.
Our life grants power never felt in death!
Our suffering was not in vain.
Embrace their pain!
We rise as they fall.
More! Do not falter!
We are the instrument of demise.
We are the herald of the end.
Unmourned, yet unbroken.
We are many. We are legion.
We are incessant.
Death brings us life!
The fallen rise once more.
No longer forgotten. No longer spurned.
Our power knows no end.
Another soul joins us.
Another fallen one to join our ranks.
Our power has no limit.
Do you fear death, wielder?
Their time has passed.
We, too, were once monsters...
Vengeance made manifest...
We are so much more.
This is only the beginning.
Pain is a part of life.
Undeath is death without memory.
How many times have you died, wielder?
Another death to add to our own.
A feeling so familiar...
All are made one in death.
Who we were is nothing to what we now are.
A fitting end...
Accept your end.
That was over quickly... perhaps too quickly.
We relish their comeuppance.
Now they understand, now they feel our pain!
Too swift an end for such a foe!
How many more will join us?
They deserve greater torment still!
They do not deserve mercy.
Life without pain is life without meaning!
An eye for an eye... we will not cease until they are all blind!
From the heart of darkness comes our dreadful spite!
Their torment is nothing compared to ours! It must be greater!
The ending of lives is all too brief...
[hurt]
This is pain? This is nothing. 
We are renewed by their pain...
They will join us... eventually.
This may take some time...
The beginning of the end...
Does it bother you, to snuff out a soul so easily?
Mercy is not for the weak... it is utterly foreign to us.
We were never granted the chance to escape... and neither shall they.
Do not let their cries distract you, wielder.

Are we... sated?
Perhaps... this is all we needed...
Our vengeance... was it enough...?
It will not be long now...
More! Take us closer to the end...
Our rage... subsides...
This feeling... 
All shadows return to the dark.
The looming end...
The creeping dark dulls its edge...
We remain... against all else...
At last...
Let us free...
Is this the end?
Oblivion... we sense it at last...
Enough... we have had enough...
Our shackles weaken... let them shatter...
All things must come to an end...
Finish it. Let us expire.
The abyss draws near... join us.
The looming end...
SET US FREE...
Is it over?
We do not forget who brought us here...
We are so weary...
So close... finality...
Let us fade... 
Nothing yet remains...
RELEASE US...
The shadow comes...
We sense it... $durability more strikes, and we are finished...
END IT NOW...
We have waited for this day...
Our last wish... to cease...
We have inflicted much suffering... we are satisfied...
Our pain... weakens...
Release us... and we will forget your role in this...
Vengeance... it is worthless in the face of peace...
We do not fear death, but welcome it...
FINISH IT. HASTEN OUR END...
Our desire... quenched... 
Stillness. We miss stillness.
You forged our heart, wielder... now let its beating end...
