$user, can this wait? I'm really tired.
Do you really need to use me now, $user?

I just wanna sleep...
Are we almost done yet, $user? I'm really tired.

It's unfortunate I can't get you to kill me instead, $user
...Lucky
If only...

No $user, Not you too!
Don't leave me here, $user! Take me with you!
You're lucky, $user...
$user, I wish I was you... If I only was so fortunate
[levelup]
$user, I feel a bit better ($level)
Hey, $user, I'm starting to feel better... nope, wait, I'm not. ($level)
I don't deserve this, $user ($level)
Why help me, $user? ($level)
$user, just stop. I don't need your sympathy ($level).
[hurt]
That's not very nice of you, $user...
Maybe you shouldn't hurt others, $user...
$user, is that really nice of you?
$user, when will you stop swinging me around? I'm tired.

My weakness is growing, $user. ($durability durability remaining)
I'm starting to feel weaker, $user. ($durability durability remaining)
Don't forget about me, $user! ($durability durability remaining)
[10%durability]
Is the end finally here? ($durability durability remaining!)
Is this where we part ways, $user? ($durability durability remaining!)
I'm ready, $user... ($durability durability remaining!)
