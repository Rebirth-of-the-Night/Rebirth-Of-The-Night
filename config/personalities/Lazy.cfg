That's it. We're done... right?
Hey, $user, we're done now, right?
Please no more...
$user, please, I can't take it anymore!
I don't know how much more work I can take!
$user, I'm not sure I'll last much longer!
All this work is killing me..
Wow, $user, this is exhausting work!
Do you really need to do this? Wouldn't you rather go sleep? I would...
C'mon, lets go sleep now. I'm tired of working...
$user, enough work. Lets go take a nap!
No more! Please! I'm begging you, $user
Are we done yet?

Look, $user, they're dead.
Nice one, $user!
Killing is so much work! I'm so tired!
Do we have to kill them, $user? Can't we just sleep?
I just want a break, $user

Make sure to come back for me, $user!
Don't forget about me, $user!

I feel... strong, $user (Level $level)!
Is this what it feels like to be good for something? (Level $level)
[hurt]
Ouch! I bet they'll feel that one tomorrow, $user!
Ooo, that looks like it had to hurt!
Ouch!
All this combat is making me so tired, $user!
Take that!
