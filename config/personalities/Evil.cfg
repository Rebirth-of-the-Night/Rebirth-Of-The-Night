Maybe you are the one that is unworthy, wielder.
Seriously? We are literally living darkness, how did you die?
[levelup]
The world darkens as I become stronger.
I can feel the power increase within me.
Their gods abandon them.
Darkness consumes all.
We are fear manifest.
Abandon hope!
You are all unworthy!
Terror stalks your world.
The unworthy shall perish.
Hahahaha.... MUAHAHAHAHA- ehem. Sorry.
[10%durability]
Darkness... will never fade... You must repair me, wielder.
