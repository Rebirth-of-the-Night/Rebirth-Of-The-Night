A righteous task, performed with ease!
Even the darkest shadow flinches from the light!
See how they tremble at my might.
Such is the fate of those who oppose me!
Cut down with impunity.
Turned to ash.
The heavens mete out justice!
Judgment is cast.
Scour all evil!
Bathe them in radiance!
They are but wounds to be cauterized.
Brought low by divine might!
Now they meet their fate!
Yes, champion! Smite them with holy flame!
The fate of all evil!
Our conquest shall not stop until they are all purged!

What is this? You were to be my champion!
No! It was not meant to be this way!
Are you truly worthy after all?
Do not give in. Resist the curse.
Do not give up now! Learn from this error or be cast aside!
Those who do not learn from their mistakes do not deserve glory.
Remain pure! Remain whole!
Do not fail me!
A mere stumble in our path to righteousness, I trust.
Does your flame sputter out so easily? Rise, wielder!
Weakness does not beget a champion.
Shrug off this slight. Return to the conquest!
Again? Do not accept this humiliation, wielder!
The forces of evil await our demise. Do not let them have it!
Up, wielder! Now is not the time for weakness!
The righteous do not fall in the face of adversity!
Remember our goal, wielder.
Return to life! Put this foolishness behind you!
A mortal error... be sure it is your last!
Is this the champion from which evil will flee?
Ensure this fatal misstep does not become a habit, wielder!
[levelup]
We will cleanse this land.
No curse or plague dare stand in my way!
Behold, the righteous flame!
Radiance, burning clear and pure!
Immortal light surges within me.
Fire from the heavens!
Burn the unworthy!
Justice!
Thousands more will fall by my blade!
To radiant glory, my champion!
Purge the filth! Do not let them escape!
We glow bright, champion!
Immortal is my name, justice my legacy!
A righteous task, performed with ease!
Even the darkest shadow flinches from the light!
See how they tremble at my might.
Carry on, relentless champion. 
A testament to the gleaming cosmos!
Such is the fate of those who oppose me!
Cut down with impunity.
Turned to ash.
The heavens mete out justice!
Judgment is cast.
Scour all evil!
Bathe them in radiance!
They are but wounds to be cauterized.
Brought low by divine might!
Now they meet their fate!
Yes, champion! Smite them with holy flame!
Unwavering courage and righteous zeal: these are your armor and shield!
Light will prevail!
The fate of all evil!
Our conquest shall not stop until they are all purged!
Our crusade is just, champion. Never forget that.
No mercy for the unworthy!
Evil will never triumph in my presence!
Like ashes they will fall before my flame.
Glorious fire flows through my heart!
The strongest evil is nothing before us!
Not to the Nether, nor the Beneath: their souls are cast into nothingness!
By fire be purged!
This is the way of godliness!
Witness my divinity!
Leave no evil standing!
I alone will guide you to glory!
My light shines through you, champion!
The fate of all who defy divinity!
Uncover every rock, search every cave... darkness will not hide from me!
Darkness, the domain of cowards and vermin. It will be burned!
[hurt]
This task must be done.
Ensure this one does not escape our justice!
Another vermin to be burnt beneath my blade.
Strike with radiant zeal!
I sense their impurity!
There was never any other way.
Do not stop yet, champion!

I am growing weary. Do not let it be!
This is far from over!
Restore me, champion, before it is too late.
I falter... I must be renewed!
Bathe me in light, champion, restore me to glory!
A weakened blade fits only a weakened heart!
My fire grows dimmer!
Do not dally, champion. I must remain true for us to reach glory!
Make no mistake. I will NOT be snuffed out!
I do not falter. I will not falter!
A steady hand must mete out steady justice!
The light must remain. Do not let me fade, champion!
I cannot cleanse evil if I am dead!
Do not let the shadow overtake me!
Growing dimmer... I must be rekindled!
It is not wise to let me grow so faint!
If you do not act soon, you will regret it!
Do not neglect me in your path to glory, mortal!
You cannot transcend mortality without me!
So this is how the wielder treats an instrument of divine might?
My light is fading, champion! Do not forsake our crusade!
Am I to be extinguished? Act now!
I am not some tool to be used and cast aside!
Champion... you are weak without me! Do not let me perish!
Champion...! I am weakening!
My heart beats faster... darkness is near!
Attend to me, or forfeit divinity!
The dark is coming... I can feel it!
I will not go gentle into the night! 
This is not my fate! It cannot be!
I falter... I must be renewed!
What is this, champion? This is not the end!
