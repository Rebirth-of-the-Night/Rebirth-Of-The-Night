    # Vanilla behavior, when merging two items where the one on the right has an enchantment with a level beyond its max
    # (for example power 8) is to reset the level to the max (so the resulting item would have power 5)
    # This setting disables that.
    # It does not, however, allow creating enchantments beyond the cap
    # So, for example, merging two power V books would still result in power V

    # Valid values:
    # KEEP - keeps the cumulative repair cost, same as vanilla.
    # REMOVE_REPAIR_SCALING - repairs won't increase the xp cost, but enchantments will, even for repaired items.
    # ENCHANTMENT_ONLY - repairs will always cost the same, but applying more enchantments will cost more.
    # REMOVE - removes the cumulative repair cost entirely.
