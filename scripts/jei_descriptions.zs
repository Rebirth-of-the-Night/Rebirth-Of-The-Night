 * 
 * Syntax
 * * The item should not be enclosed in [] unless it is a list.
 * * The description should not be enclosed in [] unless it is meant to be separated by a line break, in which case use an extra "".
 * * Try to keep separate pages of descriptions close to each other in the file...
 * * Try to separate long descriptions onto separate pages where fit.

 * * 1 line between groups within the category
 * 
 * Sorting
 * * PLEASE put descriptions in the correct category. As of this viewing, brick and wildberries are under BWM.
 * * Grouped by purpose or aesthetic
