// BoP wildberries
mods.jei.JEI.addDescription(<biomesoplenty:berries>, "A berry extracted from an unwilling hawthorn. Although they are unfulfilling and sour, some animals like them, but they are too hard to get. Horses, especially, may surprise their owners when presented with a prepared hawthorn dish.");
mods.jei.JEI.addDescription(<biomesoplenty:plant_0:5>, "The common hawthorn bush produces a sour berry and has soft leaves. When under stress or pressure from an external force trying to grab its fruit, its branches will harden and poke any unwanted visitors. The berry itself presents particular properties when prepared and fed to horses.");
