The Rebirth of the Night Team gives full permission for anyone to release a modified/spin-off version of the Rebirth of the Night Modpack (hereafter the Modpack) on CurseForge or Modrinth only. The modified version must state that it is a modified version of Rebirth of the Night and must link back to the main CurseForge page (this page) for Rebirth of the Night in a clear and concise way.

You may modify the Modpack for your own personal use, but support is not required to be given by our team for modified versions of the Modpack. This includes adding and removing mods.

You may not charge people to get access to any modified versions of the Modpack that are made. Donations are acceptable, so long as they are purely optional donations.

You may not charge people for individual assets from this pack and/or claim them as your own.

You may not redistribute non-modified versions of the pack anywhere. Modified versions can only be released on CurseForge or Modrinth.

You may not use custom-created assets from this pack and claim them as your own (this includes scripts, textures, etc). You may use scripts from this pack as an education tool to learn Zenscript, CraftTweaker, etc, but please do not copy entire scripts, artwork, etc.

All modified/spin-off versions of this Modpack must abide by this same license. Please change your license on your pack's CurseForge/Modrinth page to "Custom License" and copy and paste this license.

Please contact the Rebirth of the Night Team if you have any questions or concerns.
