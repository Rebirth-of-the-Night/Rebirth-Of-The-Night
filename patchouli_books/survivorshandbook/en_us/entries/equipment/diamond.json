I've noticed it's magical ability derives from $(thing)knowledge$() and $(thing)arcane$() origins. In terms of combat, diamond offers much $(thing)lighter weapons and tools$(), allowing you to swing faster than the other gems."

It also seems to have peculiar $(thing)anti-magic$() properties, partially shielding me from attacks that would otherwise bypass physical armor normally."
